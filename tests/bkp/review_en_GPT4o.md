**[Section 1: Understanding Digital Marketing]**

**Narrator:**
"Let’s first clear up a common misconception: Digital marketing is not about selling courses. Digital marketing is all about facilitating online sales. Every time someone buys something online, whether through a smartphone or computer, they are engaging with digital marketing. 

So, how did it all start? It began in the United States with a man named Russell. There’s a documentary about him on this channel – go check it out. Today, Russell is a billionaire, having made his fortune from home through digital marketing without ever selling a course. He developed strategies used by major online retailers like Amazon, Apple, Tesla, and Walmart.

One key strategy is Direct Response Marketing (DRM). DRM involves creating advertisements that prompt immediate responses from customers, leading them through a sales funnel until they make a purchase. Strategies like upselling, remarketing, email marketing, SMS marketing, and WhatsApp funnels are all part of this."

**[Section 2: Step-by-Step Guide]**

**Step 1: Learn About Payment Gateways**

**Narrator:**
"First, you need to understand payment gateways. These are platforms where your customers will pay for the products you sell online. Popular payment gateways include Hotmart, Shopee, Braip, Monetizze, and PerfectPay. These platforms also offer an affiliate system. As an affiliate, you can promote products and earn a commission on each sale without owning the product."

**Narrator:**
"Next, let's talk about organic traffic. This means promoting products without paying for ads. Platforms like MercadoLivre, Amazon, Magalu, TikTok, Instagram, Facebook Marketplace, and Pinterest allow you to list and promote products for free. Start by creating a business account on these platforms and learn how to make organic posts that attract customers."

**Step 3: Understand Paid Traffic**

**Narrator:**
"Once you've got the hang of organic traffic, it’s time to delve into paid traffic. Paid traffic is incredibly effective and can significantly boost your sales. Start with Facebook Ads, as it’s the easiest platform for beginners. Learn about campaign setup, ad creation, and targeting. Use the knowledge of payment gateways and direct response marketing to create compelling ads."

**Step 4: Create Your Own Product**

**Narrator:**
"After mastering both organic and paid traffic, the next step is to create your own physical product. Unlike digital products, physical products can be sold repeatedly to the same customer, creating a steady stream of income. Although creating a physical product isn’t free, it’s a worthwhile investment. Stay tuned for a future video where I’ll guide you through this process in detail."
